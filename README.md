To make recommendation on sales performance of Turtle games, several descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analysis is conducted. This is a 6-week project that I worked on during my study in LSE Data Analytics program. Repository includes following files for your reference:

1)	Analysis report
2)	PowerPoint presentation
3)	Mp4 file 
4)	Jupiter notebook for python coding
5)	R code
6)	CSV files used for analysis in programming 

In general below are the key finding that you can learn further by checking the files:

1)	How do customers accumulate loyalty points? Which variables can be used for prediction?
2)	How many customer groups are there? How can we cluster them?
3)	What do people think about turtle game products? What is the sentiment?
4)	How is the impact of sales in regions? What is their contribution for global sales?
5)	Can we predict global sales of turtle games?
